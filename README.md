# WTWR (Express Project)

This is the backend side of the WTWR website / application for the computer or phone . The app recommends the user what to wear according to the current weather at the current location displayed . Users can upload new apparel items to there profile for different weather types .

## Functionality & Technology

This was my first project using Express.js. We used both Express and Mongoose to build and connect our backend server to a MongoDB database. Built-in tools such as validator were used to ensure data integrity. API routes were tested using Postman, and all data was stored in MongoDB.

We created two Mongoose schemas, which were connected to controllers and routed through app.js using Express routers. The project was developed in Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages:
